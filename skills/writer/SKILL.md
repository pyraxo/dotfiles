# Writer

## Quick Start

When writing or editing content, follow these core principles:

1. **Write like you talk** - Use natural, conversational language
2. **Avoid AI patterns** - No delving, leveraging, or navigating complexities
3. **Be concrete** - Show, don't tell
4. **Use first person** - Share your experience, not prescriptions

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Draft

Write naturally without overthinking. If working from a transcript or voice memo, preserve the original phrasing.

See [write-like-you-talk.md](write-like-you-talk.md) for guidance on conversational writing.

### Step 2: Remove AI Patterns

Check against the AI writing patterns list:

See [dont-sound-like-ai.md](dont-sound-like-ai.md) for:
- Words to never use
- Phrases to avoid
- Structural patterns that signal AI
- Tone problems to fix

### Step 3: Apply Writing Principles

Strengthen the prose using classic principles:

See [elements-of-style.md](elements-of-style.md) for:
- Use active voice
- Put statements in positive form
- Use definite, specific, concrete language
- Omit needless words
- Keep related words together
- Place emphatic words at the end

### Step 4: Use First Person

See [first-person-preferred.md](first-person-preferred.md) for guidance on:
- Changing second person to first person
- Sharing personal experience instead of prescribing

### Step 5: Craft Hooks and CTAs (if applicable)

For posts that need engagement:

**For hooks**: See [hooks-examples.md](hooks-examples.md)
**For calls-to-action**: See [calls-to-action-examples.md](calls-to-action-examples.md)

### Step 6: Final Check

Before publishing, review against the checklist:

See [final-checklist.md](final-checklist.md) for:
- First-hand verification
- Actionability check
- Pride check

**LinkedIn writing**: See [mavens-linkedin-guide.md](mavens-linkedin-guide.md) for LinkedIn-specific guidance

**Reference posts**: See [posts-i-am-proud-of.md](posts-i-am-proud-of.md) for examples

**AI writing perspective**: See [linear-ceo-on-ai.md](linear-ceo-on-ai.md) for context

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using em dashes perfectly (—)
- Starting every sentence with "You"
- Uniform sentence length
- Excessive parallelism ("It's not X, it's Y")
- Capitalizing Everything Important
- Adding emojis unnecessarily
- Using "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"
- Hedging too much ("It may be worth considering that perhaps...")

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Concrete over abstract**: "her empty chair at dinner" not "the profound impact of loss"
2. **Active over passive**: "I remember" not "will be remembered by me"
3. **Simple over latinate**: "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate"
4. **Varied rhythm**: Mix short and long sentences
5. **Committed opinions**: Take a position, don't seesaw endlessly
